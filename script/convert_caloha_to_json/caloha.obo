The basal cells are more abundant in the proximal airways, where they form more or less, a continuous layer and gradually diminish in number in peripheral bronchi.

def: "The ventral tegmentum (tegmentum is Latin for covering), better known as the ventral tegmental area (VTA), is a group of neurons located close to the midline on the floor of the midbrain (mesencephalon). The VTA is the origin of the dopaminergic cell bodies of the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system and is widely implicated in the drug and natural reward circuitry of the brain. It is important in cognition, motivation, drug addiction, intense emotions relating to love, and several psychiatric disorders. The VTA contains neurons that project to numerous areas of the brain, from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to the caudal brainstem and several regions in between." [Wikipedia:Ventral_tegmental_area]
